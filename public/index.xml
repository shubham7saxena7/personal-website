      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been here, at this exact spot, multiple times for years. years! I&amp;rsquo;ve been smoking on and off - mostly on for the last six years. It has cost me a great deal of money, health and above all mental stress. I live in constant guilt about smoking. Each puff I take in is a torture which screams, &amp;ldquo;Why are you doing this to yourself&amp;rdquo; but I find myself helpless. My body and mind are not in tune and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly the reason for smoking-induced anxiety.</description>

Recently, I have started to feel a sense of emptiness and disconnection from my creativity and passions.</description>
