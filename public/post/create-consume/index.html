      <article class="post-content">
      <p>For a long time, I have been a passive consumer of entertainment, food, and whatnot. I would spend hours watching TV shows, scrolling through social media, and ordering takeout. I enjoyed the convenience and instant gratification of having everything at my fingertips, and I also rationalised it to myself by saying, &ldquo;This is the convenience money buys&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Recently, I have started to feel a sense of emptiness and disconnection from my creativity and passions. I realized that I was living my life on autopilot, without really engaging with the world around me. That&rsquo;s when I decided to take a step back and start exploring the concept of creating what I consume.</p>
<p>At first, it was challenging to break out of my old habits. I was used to relying on others to provide me with entertainment and food, and the idea of creating my products and services seemed daunting. But I started small, with simple things like cooking meals from scratch and drawing sketches. I found that the more I created, the more I enjoyed the process.</p>
<p>One of the things that I love about creating what I consume is that it keeps me thinking and helps me find creativity in every endeavour. Whether it&rsquo;s coming up with a new recipe for a dish or finding a new way to express my thoughts through writing, there&rsquo;s always a way to push my limits and expand my horizons.</p>
<p>Another significant change I have made is in the way I consume social media. Instead of endlessly scrolling through other people&rsquo;s content, I started creating my own. I found that sharing my own experiences and perspectives was not only more fulfilling but also helped me connect with others who share similar interests and passions.</p>
<p>As I continue to explore the concept of creating what I consume, I am discovering a newfound sense of joy and fulfilment in my life. I am feeling more connected to my own creativity and passions, and I am becoming more intentional with my time and resources. I am starting to appreciate the value of my unique perspective, and I am finding myself being more true to myself and my values.</p>
<p>Creating what you consume is not just about saving money or being more self-sufficient. It&rsquo;s about taking control of your own life and being more intentional with your time and resources. It&rsquo;s about connecting with your creativity and passions and sharing that with others. It&rsquo;s about being true to yourself and your values and making a positive impact on the world around you.</p>
