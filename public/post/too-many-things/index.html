      <p>I am gonna turn 30 in six months and for some reason, it feels like a milestone. The feeling of just getting into your middle age, not old but not young enough as well. Trust me, I feel the same or better. I have never been this energetic, wiser, organised or fulfilled in my life but turns out society dictates how you should feel and how you should act. It&rsquo;s hard to run away from that fact. The one thing that keeps me young is my ability and desire to pursue new challenges and activities.</p>
<p>Reflecting back, I didn&rsquo;t have the luxury to pursue what I liked. Life dictate what I should be doing. For example, I stopped drawing, painting and arts when I turned about thirteen. Just to focus on studies. I started to play Basketball but then in 10th standard, I had to go coaching so had to drop that too. I could have done a lot more in my college days but just didn&rsquo;t. I chose to be a lazy addict. And the job never gave me time to pursue anything meaningful. It was always about making money. Never about how happy you feel, or how fulfilled you are. Hobbies are just that. They are the things you do because you wanna do them without any external influence or by the motive of making money. You&rsquo;d do them if you had no money and you&rsquo;d do them if you were rich. Ofcourse money influenecs hobbies. you get to pursue, try and land what sticks with you and this is where I am. Vigorously trying to build my hobbies. I am growing a garden, learning to play badminton, painting, and keyboard. I am also into running and lifting weights so that takes a bunch of time too.</p>
