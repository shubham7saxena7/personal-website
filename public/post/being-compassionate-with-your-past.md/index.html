      <article class="post-content">
      <p>Whenever I have made a positive changes to my life, I often find myself wondering and a tiny bit regretting as to why I didn&rsquo;t do it earlier. This happened when I started working out consistently, got married or even pursued playing piano. I can go on and on!</p>
<p>These feelings are definitely a sign of progress in your life and should be celebrated as such. While we might regret not making that particular change earlier, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to consider that you were a different person. You had different surroundings, mindset and emotions. The thought to do that particular activity couldn&rsquo;t just have occured on its own. All of us and that includes what we do and how we behave is a product of all the factors above. The things that you just started didn&rsquo;t just happen, you arrived at it - bit by bit.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that we cannot fasttrack certain things in our lives. What has really helped me is having friendships and peers further down the line of life experiences. Seeing them operate provides massive clues into how you could do certain things and may be skip certain iterations. Life is too short to do everything the hard way. I&rsquo;ll take an example to help understand this better. Let&rsquo;s say, you just started going to the gym and are giving it all and somebody comes in - may be who&rsquo;s been here many a times before and tells you a certain order to follow or correct your form, that will fasttrack your progress significantly. You would have arrived at this but at the cost of time and may be injuries. Ofcourse they are useful too but not always. Remember, we decide the scars we wanna carry.</p>
