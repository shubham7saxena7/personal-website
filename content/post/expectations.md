I am a free man and of free will - mostly in my thoughts of what I want to do. I despise when people expect things of me especially when they are not in tune with my vision makes me a grumpy little bitch. I feel burdened. I also try to mirror this behaviour in having very few expectations of others. 

Although we are social creatures and cooperation is the key to our progress but that only when our incentives and end goals are aligned or else there will be just friction. I am also not a good employee because of the same reason - I find it really hard to give me 100% unless I am totally in sync with what we as a group want to achieve. 

Our expectations, more often than not are a product of the relationships we hold on - it can be a boss, brother, husband, father or son. In all these transactions, we are *"expected"* to behave a certain way. These expectations become duties when done continuously for a time and start to burden a man.
