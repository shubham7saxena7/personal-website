"Comparison is the thief of joy" - Roosevelt

He couldn't have been any closer to the truth. [I pursue a lot of things]() and try to learn from teachers, creators, friends and artists around but there's this urge to be as good as them. To play, draw, run or lift like the experts. While I totally understand that it is not possible for me to be as good as them - atleast not in the neat future but the emotion lingers. It is may be because I am not ***great*** at one thing but good at a lot of things and my mind craves for that expertise. 

While I am able to successfully ignore that I cannot be great at something in a short period of time, it steals the joy of creation atleast temporarily. Making peace with this fact is easier said than done. 

Also, for the generalist in me - you can be mediocre in 10 things and yet be amongst the top top people purely by how skills stack up.
