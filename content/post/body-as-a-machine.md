It is a well known adage that our bodies are a machine, the most complex of any machines to ever exist in this world. Thousands of years of genetic engineering has resulted into us being us. The down side - we do not really know how to operate it such is its complexity. We do come with a manual on how to use this machine to its fullest potential. Only through trial and error we can begin to understand how it operates at a high level. 

I've recently been binge watching the show - Air crash investigation with my wife and so many crashes were a result of the pilots not respecting what the machine said, respecting it and operating it from the manual. They would skip the checklists, not pay heed to the warnings or just do something that they weren't trained to do. Our bodies are no different. Our bodies gives us signals in so many forms and we override them without deciphering what it means. This results into suboptimal functioning and poor quality of life. We might not crash like an airplane but we wouldn't fly like we are supposed to. 

What are these signals. Some are common - like inflammation or body aches or a stomach infection. They convey that you are tired, exhausted or eaten something that wasn't accepted by your machine. Some are very specific to an individual, for example, I know that if I am not able to focus well or be present in an activity, I've not slept well. 

I am really begin to pay a close attention to how I feel and what inputs drive that and it is really helping.
