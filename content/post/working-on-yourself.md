Anyone who's been at a self improvement journey would know and understand that the journey can be lonely. It is meant to be. Any sort of improvement requires understanding yourself and more importantly discovering the latent parts of your personality. 

This aspect of the journey could make you feel you're being selfish as you are often into your thoughts thinking about that next workout or that next jam session or that next blog. If you're really excited about something and see yourself getting good at that, it's hard to not think about it. But I believe you are not selish. You might *act* selfishly in *some* moments but people who truly care about you will know, understand and even appreciate. You have a duty towards yourselves and towards your friends and families to be the best version you can be. They deserve the fittest, fulfilled and most capable person.
