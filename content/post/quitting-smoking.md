I've been here, at this exact spot, multiple times for years. years! I've been smoking on and off - mostly on for the last six years. It has cost me a great deal of money, health and above all mental stress. I live in constant guilt about smoking. Each puff I take in is a torture which screams, "Why are you doing this to yourself" but I find myself helpless. My body and mind are not in tune and that's exactly the reason for smoking-induced anxiety. It is supposed to make you feel lighter. Nicotine is a powerful drug known to relax humans and it fails to do that job for me. It leaves me feeling choking - physically and mentally.

I am so timid that I have not smoked an entire stick. ever! I just stub it and find solace in the fact that I didn't smoke the entire shit. But as I said, it's not the physical aspect but the mental aspect which causes more damage. I smoke about 4 *times* a day usually in about three hours. Not too bad but not bad. Some might say that you can leave it any day - it's just so less but smoking is an act of habit nurtured over years whose stimulus is ingrained in your lifestyle. It's a lifestyle habit. You wake up, you want that smoke, it rains - let's get that drag. Hey, it's coffee time, a smoke is mandatory. you are meeting some friends, and sharing a smoke might not hurt that much.

Any addiction - be it drinking, smoking up, cigarettes, caffeine or anything changes your psyche in unknown ways. It stops you from enjoying activities without them. you cannot imagine any event in their absence. If you're a fellow drinker, you'd know how hard it can be to go to a social gathering with friends or colleagues without booze.

But this time it's different. It is going to be different.

I didn't create any special plans or take any replacement therapies like gums/patches or drugs like Bupropion. Trust me, I've tried them all, and each of them is addicting in their unique way. It's a thing of habit and can only be broken by replacing the happiness of it with other things.

My journey this time around started with just not smoking as soon as I woke up. As and when I have the craving around noon time, I go for a walk and if I can't resist that, I take two drags and stub the stick. I have also started to run, lift weights, play badminton, and meditate and smoking affects my stamina in all of these things and this has allowed me to have an anchor. I look forward to enjoying these activities as much as I can and that in itself pulls me out of having that smoke.

The other thing that is helping me is my wife. She is a constant in my life. The nicest person I know and the most caring. I would have expected her to be angry or scold me but she dealt with it very maturely and highlighted how all of us would have to suffer if this were to cause future harm. We are a team and building a family and so it is only prudent I play my part in that. Being accountable to my future self and family does pull me out most times.

With all this said, I am not completely out in the greens. It's a habit of years and will not go away in a day, a week, or even a month. We have hidden patterns in our psyche which play out quite randomly and I have to adjust to them as they come. With my family and hobbies at my side, I have someone and something to be accountable to in each of those moments and I am quite confident of quitting it.

if you've read thus far, be empathetic to someone you see smoking and remind them how life once was without it and can be.
