I've been setting my personal office for quite some time and now that I work for a remote firt company, it becomes even more imperative that I have a good setup. Just for reference this is my desk setup

the only downside to this setup is that the laptop can move around. The laptop exposes some of my weak points. Hey, I'm lazy today, I might just work from the bed or you know what I'll sit on the sofa. These are good options but not for work. When working, you need to be in a dedicated mind space and hence the concept of office. Whenever I'm into office, I am just working and not when I am not there. Simple. There is a boundary. 

I do not even open the laptop lid. It's been two weeks. I've setup an insta 360 as a portable web cam, I use an external keyboard and mouse coupled with a good quality headset to cover for all the peripherals. Ofcourse a 4k screen for the display. 

Turning my laptop into desktop has really been a game changer. It forces me to sit on a chair and look at the monitor at a reasonable height and distance. These measures have really been good for my back, neck and eyes. 

I'll keep updating this as I find more ways to be productive with my office setup.
