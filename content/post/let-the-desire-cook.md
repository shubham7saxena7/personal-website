We are driven by our desires - the desire to eat, travel, sleep, or buy that item. Unlike our long-term goals, desires are short-term impulses fulfilling which keeps us satiated mentally. But not all desires are to be fulfilled. I've realized that our minds are lazy and wired to take the easy route. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it allows us to be influenced and directed by outside forces. You see someone enjoying a treat at McDonald's and now suddenly you have the urge to indulge, fully understanding that this might not be the healthiest option for you. Companies target our helpless minds in all possible ways, and there is no free will anymore. Our identities have been successfully tuned by these big corps to desire the newest gadget or that trip. Our brain is just the computer being trained by all possible means. This is where we need to let the desire cook. You have the urge to buy that gadget or take that trip or indulge - take a break, register that thought, and let the brain decide if it still wants it after a week/month/year. If it's still there, go for it - maybe you genuinely want it. Just maybe.
