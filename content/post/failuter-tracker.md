These are not absolute failures - just a bunch of missed targets. I do not believe that you ever fail in absolute terms!

### 2023
* failed to quit smoking
* failed to completely quit drinking - although it is control significantly
* failed to connect with older friends - I tried but never got a response back
* failed to run a 10K - got till 8K but for some reasons unknown to me, I dropped the ball
