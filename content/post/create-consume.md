For a long time, I have been a passive consumer of entertainment, food, and whatnot. I would spend hours watching TV shows, scrolling through social media, and ordering takeout. I enjoyed the convenience and instant gratification of having everything at my fingertips, and I also rationalised it to myself by saying, "This is the convenience money buys".

Recently, I have started to feel a sense of emptiness and disconnection from my creativity and passions. I realized that I was living my life on autopilot, without really engaging with the world around me. That's when I decided to take a step back and start exploring the concept of creating what I consume.

At first, it was challenging to break out of my old habits. I was used to relying on others to provide me with entertainment and food, and the idea of creating my products and services seemed daunting. But I started small, with simple things like cooking meals from scratch and drawing sketches. I found that the more I created, the more I enjoyed the process.

One of the things that I love about creating what I consume is that it keeps me thinking and helps me find creativity in every endeavour. Whether it's coming up with a new recipe for a dish or finding a new way to express my thoughts through writing, there's always a way to push my limits and expand my horizons.

Another significant change I have made is in the way I consume social media. Instead of endlessly scrolling through other people's content, I started creating my own. I found that sharing my own experiences and perspectives was not only more fulfilling but also helped me connect with others who share similar interests and passions.

As I continue to explore the concept of creating what I consume, I am discovering a newfound sense of joy and fulfilment in my life. I am feeling more connected to my own creativity and passions, and I am becoming more intentional with my time and resources. I am starting to appreciate the value of my unique perspective, and I am finding myself being more true to myself and my values.

Creating what you consume is not just about saving money or being more self-sufficient. It's about taking control of your own life and being more intentional with your time and resources. It's about connecting with your creativity and passions and sharing that with others. It's about being true to yourself and your values and making a positive impact on the world around you.
