Hey there! I'm Shubham, a software engineer from Gurgaon, India. Solving problems is my passion, and I love coding. But life is more than just work for me.

When I'm not coding, I'm all about sports. Football, basketball, and badminton get my adrenaline pumping. I am also an avid runner, constantly pushing myself to new limits.

Beyond the tech world, I maintain my own gym, garden, and office space. Reading is my escape, and occasionally, I write too. But that's not allâ€”I'm always up for new adventures. Lately, I've been exploring painting, yoga, and playing music on the keyboard.

Welcome to my world, where software engineering meets a life full of excitement, hobbies, and personal growth.
